### Background

New York Citi Bike Program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States. Since 2013, each month's bike data is collected and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. However, while the data has been regularly updated, no sophisticated report has been generated.
The aim of this project is to analyze and transform data into highly actionable insights for the New York Citi Bike Program's utilization.


### Analytics techniques used & Questions tackled 
* Aggregated and cleaned up multiple datasets from [Citi Bike Trip History Logs](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) by pandas

* A concise, interactive, and visually compelling Tableau dashboard is created to dictate programmatic changes, such as:
    How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
    
    By what percentage has total ridership grown?
    
    How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
    
    What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
    
    What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
    
    What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
    
    What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
    
    What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
    
    What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey 
    What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
    
    How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
    
    How does the average trip duration change by age?
    
    What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
    
    Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
    
    How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

* Additional visualizations embeded:

    Static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

    Dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.
